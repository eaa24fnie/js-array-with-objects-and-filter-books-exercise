// Task: Create an array of JavaScript objects where each book belongs to a specific category,
// and implement a filtering functionality that allows the user to sort books by category.

// Before you start:
// 1. Go to the "image" folder and identify the relevant books you want to include in the array.
// 2. Use websites like saxo.dk or amazon.co.uk to find detailed information about each book.
// 3. Each book must have a **category** (e.g., "fiction", "non-fiction", "science", etc.).
// 4. Implement a **filtering function** that allows the user to select a category and only see the books belonging to that category.
// TIP: Use the method from the previous task where we sorted movies and apply `.filter()` to your array.

// Example: Array of books categorized by genre
// Fiction
// {title: "The Great Gatsby", author: "F. Scott Fitzgerald", category: "fiction", publishedYear: 1925, pages: 218, images:"/img/the-great-gatsby.webp" }
